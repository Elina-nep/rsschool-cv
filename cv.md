### About myself:

I started my career at the [Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University](https://english.spbstu.ru/) as an engineer at&nbsp;the Quantum Physics department. The main project was to develop a laser sensor for blood disease diagnostics from the very beginning (mathematics and physics) to device assembling and designing the algorithms of data processing. After several years I finished my dissertation on this topic and got a&nbsp;Ph.D.&nbsp;

During this work I gained some organizational&nbsp;and leading skills too: about&nbsp;10&nbsp;students finished their scientific projects (bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s&nbsp;thesis) under my supervision. My team received a government grant for medical optical sensor development. I was a&nbsp;local organizer of international conferences (website content, communication with participants, organization of visits, etc). Several websites were given under my supervision (for instance [https://et.spbstu.ru/](https://et.spbstu.ru/)). Starting from that point my interest directed to the web design and development competencies.

Concluding all the above, I think I have enough soft skills that will compensate for my temporary lack of hard skills and help me on my way to becoming a Frontend Developer.
